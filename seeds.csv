"Asparagus Seeds Mary Washington","Easy to grow, disease resistant and delicious, Mary Washington has been the absolute gold standard for green asparagus varieties for the last century. During the early 1900s a fungal disease called Asparagus Rust travelled from Europe to the Americas, ravaging the U.S. asparagus crop. Plant explorer and breeder J.B. Norton, who worked at the USDA and with a group of Massachusetts asparagus growers, collected seeds from all over the East Coast and in Europe. He trialled countless varieties, using advanced statistical data to find successful varieties and ended up with a group of resistant asparagus types that he called Washington. ‘Mary Washington’ showed to be incredibly vigorous, and resistant to the rust. His achievement was hailed as a huge success for asparagus breeding. This scrumptious and reliable heirloom has rightly reigned supreme in gardens and on farms since it was introduced in 1919. Norton went on to dedicate the remainder of his career to breeding work with the Pedigreed Seed Company, which specialized in, you guessed it, asparagus. Full SunSprouts in 14-21 DaysSeed Depth 1/2\"Ideal Temperature: 65-75 Degrees FPlant Spacing: 18\"Frost Hardy: YAsparagus officinalis","Soak seeds 24 hours, sow indoors 2-3 months before last spring frost.

Truly Tiny banana can grow as far north as Zone 8 with protection or in heated greenhouses orsunrooms farther north. We love growing bananas in our Missouri greenhouse and get a crop in under a year. Please consider these terms before ordering live plants: Most plants will be 7 inches to 12 inches tall. Please make sure you are ready for your order in your zone as these young, tender plants generally have no resistance to cold. Plant Care Instructions: Unless in frost-free south or west, grow in pots to bring indoors for the cold months. Plant in gallon-sized pot (with drainage holes), filled with very light, well-drained potting mix. Thrives between 67 (nighttime low) and 80 degrees (daytime high) but can tolerate temps outside this range. Keep plants well watered. Fertilize with 5-5-5 or 10-10-10 once a month.

"Beet Seeds Chioggia (Bassano)","Chioggia beet is the most whimsical veggie in the patch! Slice the roots open to reveal concentric rings of pink and white, and this fun variety adds pop to salads and pizazz to pickles. Chioggia beet originated in the historic fishing town of Chioggia, Italy, just across the lagoon from Venice. Dubbed “Little Venice” for its canals and ancient charm, local Venetians know that Chioggia is the town to visit for authentic family-style food. It also has a reputation among Italians for retaining food traditions and quality cuisine. Chioggia  beet was first mentioned by legendary French seedhouse Vilmorin in 1840.  When introduced in the U.S., Chioggia beet was considered a gourmet oddity, primarily sold at upscale markets. The unusual rings were a startling departure from the typical red beet, and so the variety was not immediately embraced by the public. Today the Chioggia beet remains a popular choice for market farmers; the roots are alluring and have the culinary stamp of approval from top chefs the world over. The candy-cane striped roots have a crisp crunch when eaten raw in salads. Those who are averse to that signature earthy beet flavor will appreciate this variety, as the flavor is remarkably mellow. The greens are crisp and high quality. The flesh is very tender, mild, and sweet. 60 Days Full Sun Sprouts in 14-21 Days Seed Depth: 1/2\" Ideal Temperature: 50-85 F Plant Spacing: 4-6\"  Frost Hardy: Yes Beta vulgaris","Amend planting site with well-rotted compost, work soil deeply, and remove rocks.

"Beet Seeds Crosby's Egyptian","Crosby’s Egyptian flat beet is a market variety developed in the 19th century and still favored by farmers and market gardeners today. The unusual name stirs intrigue; beets are historically considered a crop of the European sea coast and are not typically associated with Egypt. In fact, the only thing Egyptian about this beet is its name, which is most likely tied to the “Egyptomania” that swept Europe and America during the 19th century. Napoleon’s famous Egyptian campaign sparked western interest in Egypt, influencing 1800s art, religion, and even leading to the false marketing of some goods as “Egyptian” to lend them an exotic flair. For example, the 1888 edition of J.H. Gregory’s seed catalog features Egyptian beets, as well as Egyptian sweet corn.  The “Egyptian beet” was actually a German variety introduced to the U.S. in the 1860s. This superior market strain was selected by Josiah Crosby, one of Boston’s most notable market farmers. He refined the German import for his marketing needs. He selected for a super flat saucer shape and smoother skin, as these uniform and decidedly pretty roots were more enticing for market sales. Crosby’s Egyptian beet debuted in the 1888 edition of J.H. Gregory’s catalog; it was praised for its exceptional early maturity and superior market quality. Today’s market farmers and home gardeners still appreciate Crosby’s 19th century work selecting for a perfect market variety. This perfect fall storage beet matures earlier than other storage varieties; it is a perfect late summer-sown beet to fill the winter pantry.55 DaysFull SunSprouts in 14-21 DaysSeed Depth: 1/2\"Ideal Temperature: 50-85 FPlant Spacing: 4-6\" Frost Hardy: YesBeta vulgaris","Amend planting site with well-rotted compost, work soil deeply, and remove rocks.

Boysenberry is a fabulous potpourri of America’s favorite berries, created from a cross of the European raspberry (Rubus idaeus) the European blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), American dewberry (Rubus aboriginum), and loganberry (Rubus × loganobaccus). As the story goes, in the 1930s the Knott family (of Knott’s Berry Farm fame) rescued this unique berry from near extinction on a farm owned by Rudolph Boysen. Boysenberry was immensely popular until the 1960s, when it fell out of favor because of its fragile fruit, ill-suited for shipping, and its finicky growing habit.Fortunately for us, continuous improvements have resulted in much hardier and disease-resistant plants, as well as this thornless type!

"Citrus Flying Dragon Hardy Orange (2 plants) Ships prompt","Trifoliate Orange (Poncirus trifoliata), also known as the “hardy orange” or “flying dragon,” is the most cold hardy of all citrus. Can thrive outdoors in temperatures as cold as -10 degrees Fahrenheit. Originated in Northern China and the Korean Peninsula. It is a large, deciduous shrub that produces an unusually sour, downy fruit that is medicinally beneficial  with anti-inflammatory properties and high in vitamin C and delicious when cooked. The very sour fruits not normally eaten raw. The fruit is commonly juiced, made into marmalades, jams, jellies, or candied. Trifoliate oranges are slightly smaller than conventional oranges and taste like a blend of lemon and grapefruit.  Since hardy orange is deciduous — the only one from the citrus family — the leaves will develop touches of scarlet and yellow in autumn before falling off. It is very dwarf and is used as a root stock for dwarf citrus trees. Extremely ornamental with corkscrew growth habit branches covered in large downward curved spines.  Flying Dragon is primarily pest and disease resistant, as well as heat and drought tolerant. Flying Dragon does well in containers, even pruned in bonsai fashion.  Zone 5 Cannot ship to AZ, CA, FL, GA, LA, MS, SC, TX, WV. ",""

"Corn Seeds Japanese Black Sticky","Japanese black sticky corn is a delectable sweet, waxy-textured corn used to make mochi or eaten fresh as a sweet treat in Japan. The “sticky” quality of this corn is thanks to a natural mutation. This inky black variety can be harvested immature when the kernels start to turn light purple. The ears are best steamed or grilled for a subtly sweet flavor. Across Asia you will find roadside vendors tending baskets brimming with steamed sticky corn. Plants produce tall vigorous stalks up to 6.5 feet, averaging one to two ears 7-9 inches long with 12 to 15 rows of beautiful, glossy black kernels at full maturity. The origin and history of sticky corn are steeped in mystery and mired in historical debate. This Japanese strain was originally selected from seeds brought from China around the year 1800. It is widely believed that corn was introduced to China from its native range in the Americas by Portuguese traders in the 1520s. But some historians suggest that the unusually early presence of sticky corn in China means that the crop had taken root there nearly 100 years before Columbus. These researchers believe that Chinese traders acquired corn on an expedition to Peru in the early 1400s. Ears of corn also appear to be depicted on ancient temples in India, leading some world experts to believe that Asia had discovered the Americas, long before dark-age Europe had. It has been widely debated, however, as it challenges centuries of Eurocentric historical record.Full SunSprouts in 7-10 DaysSeed Depth: 1-2\"Ideal Temperature: 75-80 FPlant Spacing: 12\"Plant Height: 6.5'Frost Hardy: NoZea mays"," Direct sow into the richest soil available 1-2 weeks before last spring frost.

"Corn Seeds Montana Cudu","A beautiful spotted variety that is descended from a historic Native American variety.  Ed Schultz, renowned corn breeder from Montana, has worked to adapt a blended corn as a tribute to a sacred Native American variety. Cudu corn is said to be an ancient native American variety used for sacred ritual. A sample of seeds was donated to the USDA seed bank by Oscar Will in 1958. The original donated seed may have been accidentally inbred or crossed, as the cobs were stunted and short, and kernels had begun to lose their signature blue eagle marking. Ed is a far northern grower who has worked to create beautiful and early-maturing corns like Atomic Orange and the Papa’s corn. He received a sample of seeds from the USDA and has worked for over five years to adapt it to his northern region and to create longer cobs. He reports that this variety has long, slender ears and beautiful blue-spotted kernels. To achieve this variety, he bred true Cudu corn with a small percentage of Papa’s White corn.Full SunSprouts in 7-10 DaysSeed Depth: 1-2\"Ideal Temperature: 75-80 FPlant Spacing: 12\"Frost Hardy: NoZea mays"," Direct sow into the richest soil available 1-2 weeks before last spring frost.

"Corn Seeds Montana Lavender Clay","A stunning lavender flour corn with long slender 8-to 12- inch long ears in an attractive pastel shade that produces silky, soft cornmeal. This vigorous and early-producing corn was bred by Ed Schultz of Montana. Ed has made a name for himself as an expert corn breeder with great knowledge and respect for the Native American corn varieties that he loves to work with. One look at the unmistakable lavender kernels shows that this blended Native American variety is descended from the lavender parching corn of the Mandan tribe. In 1808, Thomas Jefferson received seeds of a lavender-colored Mandan Red Clay corn; he reported that the seeds were given to him by Lewis and Clark from their 1804 contact with the Mandan tribe in present day North Dakota. Schultz has taken the lovely lavender-clay color and rugged cold hardiness of Mandan corn while selecting for more slender and uniform ears and short, stout plants. A stellar feat of breeding from a solid foundation of superlative ancient genetics.Full SunSprouts in 7-10 DaysSeed Depth: 1-2\"Ideal Temperature: 75-80 FPlant Spacing: 12\"Frost Hardy: NoZea mays"," Direct sow into the richest soil available 1-2 weeks before last spring frost.

Ed Schultz, renowned corn breeder from Montana, has a passion for selecting and stabilizing ancient corn varieties to restore them to how they were most likely originally grown. A small sample of seed was donated to the USDA seed bank in 1959, including a long, slender flour corn with shell-pink, eagle-shaped markings.  Ed is a far northern grower who has worked to create beautiful and early-maturing corns like Atomic Orange and the Papa’s corn.90 daysSprouts: 7 - 10 daysIdeal Temp: 75 - 80Seed Depth: 1 - 2 inchesPlant Spacing: 12\"Frost Hardy: NoFull to Partial SunZea mays","Direct sow into the richest soil available 1-2 weeks before last spring frost.

This old Southern standby, which was also formerly known as the Tory pea, dates back to the 1850s. It was especially popular in Alabama and South Carolina. Farmers of yesteryear regarded it highly for the copious foliage or organic matter it produced, making it an exemplary soil-improving companion crop to corn. Since the early 1900s, a number of seed catalogs have lauded this variety for its drought and heat tolerance. A look back through antique American catalogs, especially those from companies in the Southeastern U.S., shows that Red Ripper was a must-have on the farm as a sustainable soil builder and delicious treat. This heirloom creates long, running vines, smothered in long 12-14 inch pods that are loaded with nutritious peas, up to 18 in a single shell! The flowers are a beautiful blue color and the immature pods make a perfect green bean substitute. In its native range in Africa, the cowpea has historically been grown alongside millet and sorghum as a nurse crop to improve soil. George Washington Carver also sang the praises of this almost-miraculous soil saver.

Indeed, the lemon cucumber is a pretty convincing fake, with round, lemon yellow fruit and a swollen blossom end, just like a real lemon. Alas, the lemon cuke is a true cucumber, a result of naturally selecting for round, yellow fruit. The lemon cucumber originated in the late 19th century and was introduced to the U.S. in 1894.

The potent berries create an outstanding blue color when steeped or added to foods. These tasty berries are quickly becoming a popular fruit added to smoothies and brewed into tea.  The dried berries are great in granola and muffins or snacked on alone; you can also eat the berries fresh off the plant. Steep the berries into a beautiful blue tea; adding a few drops of lemon will turn the tea a lovely purple/pink color. Gardeners will be pleased to know this exciting berry is highly prolific and easy to grow! Plants thrive in zones 5-10.  It grows as a shrub reaching 4-6 feet in height, and the plants are self fertile.

"Gourd Seeds Giant Bushel Basket","Would you like to be able to grow gourds that weigh over 150 pounds?  How about 200 pounds?  We did just that, and we will have a limited number of seeds available. These seeds all come from fruit weighing between 75 and 217 pounds! These were grown at Baker Creek's Mansfield, Missouri, farm.  To grow truly giant fruit, it is typically necessary to reduce the runners down to just one primary vine and to grow only one fruit per plant.  But we were able to grow these colossal gourds without any pruning, proving that this strain of Giant Bushel Basket Gourd has the genetics to produce enormous fruit! It's a gargantuan gourd, perfect for competition growing or to impress your friends and family! We harvested seeds from gourds weighing at least 75 pounds to increase your odds of harvesting a truly mammoth fruit. These spectacular specimens can be used for craft projects, art pieces, or made into utilitarian containers. And this one happens to even be edible, with a crisp, clean, cucumber-like taste.  You are in for a show, as the long vines meander across the garden and the fruit quickly swells to stunning sizes!  Be sure you allow enough space for the plants to get huge - at least 10 feet between plants.  These are heavy feeders so deep, rich soil with high organic matter will help.  We recommend a triple 20 fertilizer applied as needed and make sure your plants get plenty of water.  To aid germination, clip or crack the seed coat at the very top (opposite the pointy end) before planting. This will help the seed imbibe water. We started our seeds indoors in April and took our first harvest in early October, so 150 to 180 days from seeding may be needed to get your gourds to their maximum potential.Sprouts: 3 - 10 daysIdeal Temp: 75 - 90Seed Depth: 1 inchPlant Spacing: 18 - 24\"Frost Hardy: NoFull SunLagenaria Siceraria","Trellising is suitable.

"","An antioxidant-rich garden berry that undergoes the most miraculous flavor transformation when cooked and just lightly sweetened! There is a stark contrast between eating the berries raw and in their cooked and sweetened state. The raw ripe berries have a tart flavor, similar to tomatillo, yummy for savory snacking and salsas. The cooked and lightly sweetened berries are reminiscent of blackberry or gooseberry. The garden huckleberry is native to Africa and is a solanaceous berry in the tomato family. The intense purple-black hue of the berries indicates high levels of the antioxidant anthocyanin. We adore this nutritious, quick-maturing annual that produces masses of fruit in a short season. For very best flavor it is important to harvest at the correct stage. Berries will be a shiny, green to black when under-mature; at this stage the flavor will be unpleasant and the berries may be slightly poisonous. The berries mature to a dull black color and should be slightly soft to the touch; at this point the berries are perfect to eat and quite tasty. The truly spectacular flavor of these berries is revealed when the berries are cooked and sweetened; this brings out a fruity, blackberry-like flavor that is simply sublime.

In “The Vegetable Garden” in 1885, French seed house Vilmorin mentioned this ancient variety from the U.K. as a productive, multi-branching type that also goes by the name “Branching Borecole.” Vilmorin also noted that the variety originally hailed from western France. Peter Miller of Kings Seed mentioned that Thousandhead kale was long appreciated in the U.K. as a fodder crop, but it has been rediscovered as a tasty culinary variety. Its leaf structure also makes for easier pest management. Those who have struggled with cabbage worms understand how caterpillars love to hide in the folds of curly kale leaves. This variety is just lightly curled at the edges, making caterpillars easier to spot and treat!

This exceptionally easy to grow annual has become a mainstay of market farmers and home gardeners, as it is a cold-hardy, cut- and-come-again green to grow in spring, winter and fall. Samples of wild claytonia were collected in 1735 by botanist John Clayton.

This light and refreshing green will grow in a variety of soils and thrives in cool and cold weather. It is commonly grown throughout winter in fairly mild climates and can grow over winter in the north with just a bit of protection.

"Litchi Tomato Seeds Litchi Tomato or Morelle De Balbis","The most intriguing garden berry we have ever seen, and with superb creamy and mild cherry flavor. A totally unique fruit, it is delightful to imagine litchi tomato into myriad culinary interpretations from mock cherry pies to chutneys and pickles. Its Latin name is Solanum sisymbriifolium, but it goes by many aliases:  Vila Vila in Latin America, litchi tomato in the U.S. and in France, Morelle de Balbis. It is a favorite fruit here at Baker Creek and has even been seen growing in the home garden of Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. While the alien-like plants may seem like a new innovation, litchi tomato was celebrated in seed catalogs of antiquity as an exotic and delicious fruit. The 1896 Wilson’s Seed Farm catalog featured a plant referred to as Solanum anthrophagorum.  It was described as a bright red fruit that lends well to pies and sauces. The Wilson’s catalog also told of the fruit being used as a condiment for a cannibal’s meal of human flesh in Fiji.  Botanists believe the litchi tomato to be native to South America, yet early accounts mention it as a plant growing in the islands of the South Pacific. Large plants grow to 5 feet and are covered with thorns, sweet red fruit, and large white flowers. Lovely to look at, but be careful with the thorns! The fruit is about the size of a cherry and tastes like a cherry crossed with a tomato. A very pretty and attractive plant that originated in South America, but has been naturalized in many countries. You can grow litchi tomato just as you would grow regular tomatoes.  A great source of vitamins A and C!75-90 days8-12 hours of SunSprouts in 14-21 DaysIdeal Temperature: 75-85 Degrees FSeed Depth: 1/8\"Plant Spacing: 18\"Frost Hardy: NoSolanum sisymbriifolium","Start transplants indoors 6-10 weeks before last frost, barely covering.

One lady, Alice Vonk of Sully, Iowa, sent seeds for 21 years, and in 1975, Burpee awarded her the coveted prize for her work—after the company had spent more than five decades and $250,000 testing during the contest years.

"Pea Seeds King Tut Purple","A very rare and amazing garden pea! One of the most historical peas known, this particular variety is said to have been taken from the tomb of famed Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun, or King Tut. The story is, his servants planted and harvested these peas to help provide for his afterlife.  Though some claim to have debunked the story, Lynn McKee’s family tradition asserts that her father received the seeds found in the boy King’s tomb, where they had been undisturbed for nearly 5,000 years until Howard Carter found the tomb on Nov. 4, 1922. From there, as the legend goes, the seeds were taken to England where they were propagated and shared with friends. “The conditions within Egyptian pyramids are very dry and would permit seed longevity in certain species to extend to thousands of years,” one document said. Some claim, though, it is likely the seeds originated in early 20th century English gardens.  The Fortean Times says “It is sometimes said that Tutankhamun’s Pea originated on the country estate of Lord Carnarvon, who financed Howard Carter’s search for King Tut’s resting place and was subsequently named in honor of Carnarvon’s claim to fame, rather than the plant’s origin.” As an interesting turn to the story, we located the seed and found the story from Japanese seed collectors during our travels there.  Stunning fuschia purple flowers give way to tasty, fat purple pods on strong and vigorous plants that love cool weather.  This variety has proven highly productive and makes a delicious soup pea, or pick it young as a purple snow pea.

"Pea Seeds Lillian's Caseload","One of the best-tasting peas we have ever tried. This superior variety was saved by a Mennonite farmer named Lillian. It is not an old, storied heirloom of antiquity, but rather a discontinued commercial variety that this family did not want to see disappear.

This amazing insect-eating perennial is native to the deep southeastern portion of the U.S. Lovely flowers are various shades of red. Amazing trumpet-like frilled foliage, (the pitchers), are white-topped and delicately marbled with red and/or green veins. First-year plants usually make 1–3 pitchers in the spring, some flat leaves in midsummer, and 1-3 of the most colorful pitchers in late Aug.–Oct.  The plants require an acidic, low mineral soil and moist to wet conditions, This can easily be accomplished by container planting in a mix of peat moss and sand or perlite. Full sun for five hours or more is required; indoor growing is not advised, due to light and dormancy needs.  We ship 100% nursery- propagated bare root mature rhizomes, ready to plant and start growing.

"Pitcher Plant Seeds Mix","Sarracenia, or trumpet pitcher plants, are beautiful, fascinating carnivorous plants native to North America. At their Botanique nursery in Virginia, botanist Robert Sacilotto and co-owner Butch Bailey have been careful stewards of rare, and often endangered, species of carnivorous plants for decades.  We are so pleased to offer their exquisite mix of seeds for Sarracenia varieties, chosen for their beauty. The mix will vary, but may include:  Sarracenia alata, the Pale Pitcher plant. The very slender, tall pitchers reach 26 inches or more.  S. flava, the Yellow Pitcher plant, has tall, showy funnels and a wide variety of color variants.  The showy pitchers of S. lucophylla, or White-topped pitcher, have many color variations and a striking stained-glass pattern. This mix may include Botanique’s Hot Pink lucophylla, which really put on a show in late summer and fall. S. minor, the Hooded Pitcher plant, has pitchers of 6 to 10 inches tall. The translucent windows on the back of the pitcher confuse prey as to which way is out.  S. purpurea, the Purple Pitcher plant, is the most widespread and familiar species of Sarracenia. The green pitchers, usually with red veins or zones, turn to deep burgundy when the weather gets cold. S. psittacina, the Parrot Pitcher plant, produces rosettes of teardrop-shaped pitchers with bulbous heads and a beak-like opening. The flowers are deep red, and the leaves are marked with red veins and white spots. Rob likens this mix to a “Sarracenia lottery, only the odds of getting amazing plants are much, much better!” Sarracenia plants are perennial and cold hardy. They are very much at home at the water’s edge or as part of a bog garden. Botanique recommends mulching them in USDA zones 6 and 7, where temperatures drop below zero, and protecting them against prolonged freezing temperatures north of zone 6. For the best growth, Sarracenia plants need at least six hours of direct sun during spring and summer.  Seeds require a period of moist stratification before starting. Detailed instructions for stratifying seeds will be included with each order. For instructions on how to germinate, start, grow, and save sarracenia, see our growing guide.** All images Pitcher Plant varieties in this mix are courtesy of Robert Sacilotto. ",""

The village of Corrales was founded on the banks of the Rio Grande, and the Spanish colonists had brought safflower seeds possibly collected from their stop in the Island of La Palma, in the Canary Islands, where a famous strain was then cultivated.

"Sweet Potato Plants Nancy Hall (5 plants) ships prompt","Nancy Hall is an heirloom sweet potato with deep roots in the southeastern U.S. For decades, it dominated the commercial sweet potato market, and was once so popular that in 1939 the folks in Paris, Tennessee, held a “Nancy Hall Sweet Potato Jubilee.” It’s not clear how this potato got its name; one story from the late 1890s claims that it was an accidental cross of potato and flower seeds by Miss Nancy Hall. Regardless of its origin, the Nancy Hall has firm, goldenflesh and tan skin, and while it never grows to gargantuan size, the 4- to 8-inch-long tubers keep well and deliver superb flavor. In the 1980s, new sweet potato varieties such as the Beauregard overtook Nancy Hall’s place in the commercial market, and it is now quite rare. This historic variety is included in the Slow Food Ark of Taste, and it deserves to be grown and preserved!
